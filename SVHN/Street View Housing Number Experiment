To illustrate that our proposed DFTN can also be applied to other types of data classification ,we carried out additional experiment by 
using the real-world dataset, Street View House Numbers (SVHN) [26]. To maintain a fair comparison, we followed the experiment design given in [16], and performed pre-processing on the dataset to crop the data
by taking both 64×64 and 128×128 crops around each digit sequence. We then repeated the training of the baseline [3] for both STN+CNN [16]
(single and multiple STN) and the proposed DFTN+CNN to complete the classification experiment, and the results are given in the next table. 
From the results,it can still be concluded that our proposed DFTN achieves a better performance than the existing STN.
